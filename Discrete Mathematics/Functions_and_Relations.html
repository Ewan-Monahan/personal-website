      <p>
        Before we learn about relations and functions, we must realised that items or 'elements' can be grouped in ordered or unordered fashion.<br><br>
        Unordered pairs are denoted by square brackets, $[a,b]$. <br>
        Ordered pairs, however, are denoted inside round brackets $(a,b)$. <br> 
        In the case of unordered pairs, $[a,b] = [b,a], [j,z] = [z,j], [2,5] = [5,2]$ and so forth.<br> 
        When it comes to ordered pairs, order matters! $(a,b) \neq (b,a)$<br>
        An example of ordered pairs are coordinates on an x,y plane. We know that the coordinates (3,5) are very different to (5,3). <br> <br>

        A <strong><em>relation</em></strong> $R$ between sets $A$ and $B$ is a set of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a \in A$, $b \in B$. It is a subset of $A \times B$<br>
        A <strong><em>function</em></strong> is a relation in which no element of the domain appears more than once as a first ordinate.<br><br>
        Or more formally, <br>A relation is a function $\iff (x,y) \in R$ and $(x,z) \in R \implies y=z$
